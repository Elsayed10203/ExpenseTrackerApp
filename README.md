# Expense Tracker - .NET MAUI

## üßæ Overview
The **Expense Tracker** is a cross-platform mobile application built using **.NET MAUI**.  
It helps users efficiently record, categorize, and analyze their expenses with a clean Material Design interface.  
The app demonstrates best practices in **MVVM architecture**, **dependency injection**, and **service abstraction** for real-world scalability.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The application follows the **MVVM (Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìViewModel)** pattern using **CommunityToolkit.MVVM** **Fresh MVVM**   to ensure clean separation of concerns and testability.

### Key Layers
- **UI Layer (Views & XAML Pages)**  
  Defines the visual presentation using MAUI controls and Material Design styling.

- **ViewModels (Logic Layer)**  
  Handles UI state and commands using `ObservableObject`, `RelayCommand`, and `INotifyPropertyChanged`.

- **Services Layer**  
  Contains interfaces and implementations for data access (`IHttpClientService`, `IExpenseService`), abstracting away API or mock data operations.

- **Models**  
  Defines the app‚Äôs domain entities like `Expense`, `Category`, and `User`.
